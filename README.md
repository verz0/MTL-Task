I have tried to implement MTL architecures for Object and Lane Detection from scratch in the above python notebooks. The document and the comments in the notebook should give a fair amount of understanding of what I have tried to implement.
Since I have failed to provide complete and working architectures, a final evaluation and comparison of both the architectures was not possible
